Silhouette Score: Essentially takes mean distance between given sample and all other points in cluster and then the same for the nearest cluster. Then takes this mean across all samples.
-The score is higher when clusters are dense and well separated, which relates to a standard concept of a cluster.
-The score is bounded between -1 for incorrect clustering and +1 for highly dense clustering. Scores around zero indicate overlapping clusters.

AIC/BIC score
-A lower AIC score is better.
-Penalizes for more clusters
-Used for comparing models not fit itself
-The lower is the BIC, the better is the model to actually predict the data we have, and by extension, the true, unknown, distribution
-Steeper Slope is better

Log Likelihood
-

Homogeneity/Completeness Score
-N
Adjusted Rand Index: measures the similarity of the two assignments, ignoring permutations and with chance normalization
- 1 is best, random labels would get 0, bad labels get -1
