3 Problems
4 Algorithms

Each algorithm applied to each problem

Problem is just a fitness function trying to maximize (as opposed to a cost function one is trying to minimize).
Chosen problems should be over discrete-valued parameter spaces. Bit strings are preferable.

problem 1 - highlight genetic algorithm
problem 2 - highlight simulated annealing
problem 3 - highlight mimic algorithm

Use randomized hill climbing, simulated annealing, genetic algorithm, to find weights for neural network replacing
backpropagation.
